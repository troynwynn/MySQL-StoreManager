// 5. Then create a Node application called `bamazonCustomer.js`. Running this application will first display all of the items available for sale. Include the ids, names, and prices of products for sale.

// 6. The app should then prompt users with two messages.

//    * The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
//    * The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.

// 7. Once the customer has placed the order, your application should check if your store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.

//    * If not, the app should log a phrase like `Insufficient quantity!`, and then prevent the order from going through.

// 8. However, if your store _does_ have enough of the product, you should fulfill the customer's order.
//    * This means updating the SQL database to reflect the remaining quantity.
//    * Once the update goes through, show the customer the total cost of their purchase.
